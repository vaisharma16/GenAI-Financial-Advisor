All funds are divided into different categories based on the amount of risk they take.\nAfter the risk profile, the most important factor is the expense ratio. Higher expense ratios mean higher costs for you as an investor. Therefore, it's always recommended to go with a low expense ratio fund.\nApart from expense ratio, there are many other factors like lock-in period, type of fund, etc\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
